I am a Learner, Computer Enthusiast, Reader and an Intermediate 2nd Year ISC student.<br>
I started coding when I was 14 years old and now I am studing Computer Science in my school Tagore Academy.
I want to become a developer in future and want to contribute in the open-source community and join the developer community. I have some begginer-level projects with the concepts that I am learning in my High-School with java. Apart from coding and programming, I also run my mother's youtube channel from which I got to know about and learn new skills like video-editing, SEO and many more...
I just want to keep learning, exploring and solve real-world problem with my creativity and skills.
